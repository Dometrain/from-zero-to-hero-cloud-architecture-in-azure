# Design Principles

## Scalability
- Prefer horizontal scaling over vertical scaling
- Strive for independent scaling on own resource commands
- Decouple components
- Create stateless services

## Elasticity 
- Design for elasticity 

## Reliability 
- Design for failure
- Graceful degradation

## Interoperability
- API-first design

## Cost
- Pay for consumption, not capacity (pay-as-you-go)
- Don't introduce components that you do not really need

## Security
- Securely store and manage sensitive information

## Autentication and Authorization
- Use tokens for authNZ
