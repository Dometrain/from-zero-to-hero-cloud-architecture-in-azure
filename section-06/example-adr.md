# ADR-001: Adoption of Azure Serverless Model for Integration Services

## Status

Accepted

## Context

GreenChain Logistics requires integration with third-party logistics providers and environmental agencies to support its eco-friendly supply chain management for sustainable consumer goods. These integrations need to handle variable workloads with frequent spikes during specific business cycles. 

Key architecture characteristics identified (overall):
- **Scalability and Elasticity**: The integration services must scale automatically based on demand
- **Cost**: Costs should align with actual usage, with a focus on pay-as-you-go
- **Interoperability**: The services must be able to integrate with a variety of external systems and devices, and vice vesra
- **Reliability**: Downtime must be avoid, mainly due to the costs associated with it

Design principles established (specific to integration services):
- Horizontal scaling over vertical scaling
- Components should scale independently based on their own resource demands
- Design for elasticity with automatic resource adjustment
- Create stateless services for easier scaling
- Implement consumption-based pricing models (pay for what you use)
- Decouple components for better scalability and reliability

## Decision

We will implement integration services using Azure's serverless model, specifically:

1. **Azure Functions** for HTTP-triggered processing and data transformation
2. **Logic Apps** for orchestrating complex workflows and managing integration sequences

This approach will handle the various third-party integrations required for logistics providers and environmental agencies through standardized connectors and custom processing logic.

## Consequences

### Benefits

1. **Improved Scalability**: Automatic scaling based on incoming requests without manual intervention
2. **Cost Optimization**: Pay-per-execution model reduces costs during low-traffic periods
3. **Reduced Operational Overhead**: No server management, patching, or capacity planning required
4. **Integration Capabilities**: Built-in connectors in Logic Apps accelerate integration with common providers
5. **Independent Scaling**: Each function scales independently based on its specific workload
6. **Statelessness**: Serverless architecture encourages stateless design patterns

### Trade-offs (if we had not chosen serverless)

1. **Higher Base Costs**: Traditional VM or container-based solutions would require paying for idle capacity
2. **Manual Scaling Operations**: Without serverless, we'd need to implement auto-scaling mechanisms or manually scale
3. **Increased Operational Burden**: Managing infrastructure would require dedicated DevOps resources
4. **Longer Development Cycles**: Building custom integration frameworks would delay time-to-market
5. **Fixed Architecture**: Less flexibility to adapt to changing integration requirements
6. **Complex Elasticity**: Implementing true elasticity would require significant custom development
7. **State Management Complexity**: Traditional architectures often encourage stateful designs that are harder to scale

This serverless approach aligns with our need for cost-efficient, scalable, and elastic integration services.
