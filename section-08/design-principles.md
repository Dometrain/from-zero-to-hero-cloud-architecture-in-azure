## Scalability 
- Separation of read and write concerns
- Decouple components
- Prefer horizontal scaling over vertical scaling 
- Strive for independent scaling on own resource demands
- Create stateless services
- Prefer asynchronous communication

## Performance 
- Separation of read and write concerns
- Event-first design
- Prefer asynchronous communication

## Availability
- Design for failure

## Auditability 
- Event-first design
- Single source of truth

## Evolvability 
- Decouple components
